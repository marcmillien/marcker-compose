Just an other try to make docker-compose usable on mac.

It wraps vagrant through ssh, nothing more.
You can use ssh-agent.

 - vagrant
 - virtualbox

### Install

Just put the `marcker-compose` script in one of your bin path dir.

### First run

Run `marcker-compose setup`

Go inside your docker-compose project, then:
```
marcker-compose up
```

Enjoy ;).
